# andromedabot
twitter bot to tweet parts of hubble's massive andromeda galaxy photo

#How to use
You'll need a copy of the photo itself, which I'm not including because it's 4.6gb. Download that here: http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1502a/

I broke mine into tiles because it was very resource-intensive to not do that. I used imagemagick.
